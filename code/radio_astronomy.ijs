NB. assume 256 antennas
N =: 256

NB. number of samples
S =: 1024

NB. time between samples
tdelta =: 1.0 % 1000.0

NB. adverb to generate samples 

NB. usage:   func sample 

NB. voltages at X pol input - dummy for now
vx =: N # 0.5

NB. voltages at Y pol input
vy =: N # 0.3

NB. model antenna response - how?


array =: 256 # 0.5j0.4
